### Last passenger quiz simulation in python

Solving a popular quiz with last passenger by simulating quiz conditions in python.

Here is the quiz:
Imagine there are a 100 people in line to board a plane that seats 100. The first person in line realizes he lost his boarding pass so when he boards he decides to take a random seat instead. Every person that boards the plane after him will either take their "proper" seat, or if that seat is taken, a random seat instead.

Question: What is the probability that the last person that boards will end up in his/her proper seat.

Simulation allows to enter number of flights and flights to calc probability for different ammount of flights and passengers.
By default the simulation will be provided for 100 flights with 100 passengers each.
